### Code guidelines

We do not have strong guideline for our contributions and are happy to help.

1. Please follow [this](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) styleguide for your contributions.

We want to keep dependencies to a minimum:

2. Please use the [`data.table`](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) for data wrangling.

3. Please use the lightweight [`jsonlite`](https://github.com/jeroenooms/jsonlite) package for handling JSON.

4. Be nice to the resources! Use appropriate timeouts.

5. Tests go into a separate tests branch and not in the master branch.
